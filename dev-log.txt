  Goals

   * Refactor UI to display appropriate screens and send signals to game to update game state, attack, etc.

  Tasks Worked On:

    1. Slightly refactored the DisplayDriver object to scale only while drawing and keep
       positions relative to the baseWidth and height of the game
    
  Session highlights:  
    
    What went well: 
      * Worked on relative positioning and established a good way to handle each characters position

    What didn't go well: 
      * Struggled to debug the drawing 
      * Was not able to start on the UI redesign because of the time spent debugging the drawing issues

  Key learnings:

    * It is easier to keep positions relative to one ratio and scale only while drawing

  Random thoughts: 

    * Even though the DisplayDriver keeps scales during drawing and keeps everything relative to the targets
      aspect ratio, the UI cannot function this way. I want the UI to be adaptive to the users screen to allow
      for seemless adjustment and less potential for missing space. The position will not be fixed to the 
      current resolution of the target canvas rather it will change relative to the full canvas. However, the
      size of each element might be fixed relative to the target canvas. Not sure we will see

  Next steps:

    * Continue to work on UI redesign - this will allow the game play to start being worked on
    * Start working game loop programming, attacks, chossing targets, etc
    * Build a full team with all the characters planned in the game (only 3 for now)
