  Goals

   * Refactor UI to display appropriate screens and send signals to game to update game state, attack, etc.

  Tasks Worked On:

    1. Slightly refactored the DisplayDriver object to scale only while drawing and keep
       positions relative to the baseWidth and height of the game
    
  Session highlights:  
    
    What went well: 
      * Worked on relative positioning and established a good way to handle each characters position

    What didn't go well: 
      * Struggled to debug the drawing 
      * Was not able to start on the UI redesign because of the time spent debugging the drawing issues

  Key learnings:

    * It is easier to keep positions relative to one ratio and scale only while drawing

  Random thoughts: 

    * Even though the DisplayDriver keeps scales during drawing and keeps everything relative to the targets
      aspect ratio, the UI cannot function this way. I want the UI to be adaptive to the users screen to allow
      for seemless adjustment and less potential for missing space. The position will not be fixed to the 
      current resolution of the target canvas rather it will change relative to the full canvas. However, the
      size of each element might be fixed relative to the target canvas. Not sure we will see

  Next steps:

    * Continue to work on UI redesign - this will allow the game play to start being worked on
    * Start working game loop programming, attacks, chossing targets, etc
    * Build a full team with all the characters planned in the game (only 3 for now)

  Goals:
    
    * Build team with all characters, and begin animating idle sprites

  Tasks Worked On: 
    
    1. Added a team construction function to gameState. Just makes a team of all three available characters

  Session highlights:  
    
    What went well: 

    What didn't go well: 

  Key learnings:

  Next steps:

    * Continue to work on UI redesign - this will allow the game play to start being worked on
    * Start working game loop programming, attacks, chossing targets, etc
    * Animate characters idle positions and attacks. Find effecient way to deal with multiple sprite images

Date: 01/25/25

  Goals:
    
    * redesign UI

  Tasks Worked On: 
    
    * Rewrote UI components and made the UI positioning relative to target aspect ratio
      this eliminated a need to recalculate the UI position on evert resize

  Session highlights:  
    
    What went well: 

      * I was able to trim the UI components down and make the system much easier to us

    What didn't go well: 

      * I wasn't able to complete the system that changes screens based on user input

  Key learnings:

    * UI is hard :( 

  Random thoughts:

    * Padding on the buttons is only padding bottom. I can maybe consider changing this to another type of 
      padding but it really doesn't matter all too much. Maybe I will fix this when/if the UI becomes too
      intense

  Next steps:

    * Add a way to switch subscreens in the current UI system
    * Start working game loop programming, attacks, chossing targets, etc
    * Animate characters idle positions and attacks. Find effecient way to deal with multiple sprite images
